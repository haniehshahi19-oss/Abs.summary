# AbsSummarize Bot
A Dify-powered micro-summarization chatbot that compresses any academic paper into one high-signal English sentence.

## What This Bot Does
AbsSummarize receives:
- Article Title
- Article Abstract

and returns ONE ultra-compressed sentence (max 22 words) summarizing the core idea of the paper.

## Key Features
- Single-sentence scientific summarization  
- Strict 22-word limit  
- No title repetition, no meta text, no intros  
- Optimized for API, Telegram bots, and GitHub workflows  
- Ideal for fast academic indexing

## How It Works
1. User inputs {{title}} and {{abstract}}  
2. Dify prompt enforces:
   - English-only  
   - No copy/paste from abstract  
   - No phrases like “This paper… / We propose…”  
3. Output is returned as one compressed, high-signal sentence.

## Input Format
Title: <paper title> Abstract: <paper abstract>
## Output Format
<one compressed English sentence, max 22 words>
